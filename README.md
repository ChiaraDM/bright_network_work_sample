Pathfinding algorithm to create a path on a 2D-grid that contains a starting point (x,y), a delivery point (x,y)
and a number of obstacles. It is possible to navigate to any of the adjacent squares (even diagonally), as long as the
squares are inbound and do not contain an obstacle.

Solved calculating distance between two points using the Euclidean distance however the A* search algorightm is more efficient.
